Instructions to compile and deploy the MoviePick as a RESTful service
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses an ant build file to compile the code, create a war
archive, and deploy on our JBoss server on uml.  The ant script 
is in the build.xml file.  You may use it as an example for future
projects.


1. Compile the server classes:

   ant compile

   This should create the necessary class files and place them in the
   classes directory in the WEB-INF subdirectory of the application.
   The root directory of the application is called WebContent.

2. Create the war archive:

   ant war

   This should create the file movies.war in this directory.

3. Deploy the application to JBoss

   ant deploy

   This should copy the war file into the JBoss deployments
   directory.  Verify it by looking at the JBoss log file:

   tail /opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log

4. At this point, you should be able to interact with the
   deployed service by running requests from a suitable browser
   plugin, such as RESTClient for FireFox.  Many plugins of this type
   are available for various browsers.

5. Compile the client program 

   ant client

   This should create a compiled version of a simple Java program
   which illustrates how to use the deployed MoviePick service from
   a Java program, using the REST client interface.
 
6. Run the client:

   sh RunClient.sh

   This should make a few requests on the service and report the
   results.

   The client is executed from this shell script to make it easier to
   provide all of the necessary jar files.  The necessary jar files
   for the client are in lib subdirectory.
