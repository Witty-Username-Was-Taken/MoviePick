Instructions to compile and deploy the MoviePick as a RESTful service
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses an ant build file to compile the code, create a war
archive, and deploy on our JBoss server on uml.  The ant script 
is in the build.xml file.  


1. Compile the server classes:

   ant compile

   This will create the necessary class files and place them in the
   classes directory in the WEB-INF subdirectory of the application.
   The root directory of the application is called WebContent.

2. Create the war archive:

   ant war

   This creates the file cs8350_3_movies.war in this directory.

3. Deploy the application to JBoss

   ant deploy

   This should copy the war file into the JBoss deployments
   directory.  We Verified it by looking at the JBoss log file:

   tail /opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log

4. Afetr this point,we were able to interact with the
   deployed service by running requests from a suitable browser
   plugin, such as RESTClient for FireFox and POSTMAN for Chrome.  
   
  Base URL : http://uml.cs.uga.edu:8080/cs8350_3_movies/api/movie

5. Compile the client program 
   
   Change to the root directory /cs8350_3_movies/client.java
   
   ant client

   This command creates a compiled version of a simple Java program
   which illustrates how to use the deployed MoviePick service from
   a Java program, using the REST client interface.
 
6. Run the client:

   sh RunClient.sh

   This should make a few requests on the service and report the
   results.

   The client is executed from this shell script to make it easier to
   provide all of the necessary jar files.  The necessary jar files
   for the client are in lib subdirectory.
